# Object Recognition README

This repository contains code for object recognition using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The code consists of functions for loading and preprocessing the dataset, data augmentation, training the model, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or above)
- TensorFlow (version 2.0 or above)
- OpenCV (version 4.0 or above)
- NumPy (version 1.18 or above)
- scikit-learn (version 0.23 or above)
- xml.etree.ElementTree (built-in library)

## Dataset

The dataset should be organized in the following directory structure:

```
data_dir/
    ├── images/
    │   ├── image1.jpg
    │   ├── image2.jpg
    │   └── ...
    ├── annotations/
    │   ├── xmls/
    │   │   ├── image1.xml
    │   │   ├── image2.xml
    │   │   └── ...
    │   └── trimaps/
    │       ├── image1.png
    │       ├── image2.png
    │       └── ...
    └── annotations/
        └── list.txt
```

The `images` directory should contain the input images in JPEG format. The `annotations/xmls` directory should contain XML files corresponding to the annotations of the images. The `annotations/trimaps` directory should contain the trimap images in PNG format. The `annotations/list.txt` file should contain a list of image filenames along with their corresponding class, species, and breed IDs.

## Usage

To use the code, follow these steps:

1. Set the `data_dir` variable in the main script to the path of your dataset directory.

2. Run the main script:

```python
import os
import cv2
import numpy as np
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.utils import class_weight

# Copy and paste the code here
```

The script will load the dataset, preprocess the images, split the dataset into training and testing sets, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Functions

```python
# Copy and paste the functions here
```

## Conclusion

This code provides a framework for object recognition using TensorFlow and OpenCV. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can train a model on your own dataset and evaluate its performance. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different models, architectures, and data augmentation techniques to improve the results.
